## Introduction
BPA is a decentralized building plan and management system engaging citizens and RERA certified contractors with RERA Authority acting as its primary administrator. 

From enquiry on approved building plans to guidelines on immaterial changes for non-structural building works, BPA helps a citizen get the approval for plot/apartment/flat abiding by the laws created by RERA. BPA provides a faster and convenient processing of payments using blockchain.

The system will act like a peer-to-peer network for citizens who paid for a building contract and awaiting approval from the RERA authority. Giving them timely information of the progress that took place from the point of submission.
